# FILE: app/services/resume_enricher.py
# ==============================================================================
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE (GUIDE):
#   This is the FINAL and LARGEST step of the pipeline — it's what actually
#   produces the numbers and written feedback the user sees on their
#   dashboard (ATS score, per-dimension bar chart, strengths, improvements,
#   skill gaps, grammar issues).
#
#   Full pipeline:
#       resume_parser.py --> keyword_extractor.py --> jsearch_client.py --> resume_enricher.py (THIS FILE)
#       (bytes -> structured   (structured resume      (keywords -> real     (resume + keywords + real jobs
#        ParsedResume)           -> keywords)             job listings)        -> score + feedback dict)
#
#   As the module docstring below explains, this file is a full local
#   (no external API, no cost) replacement for what used to be a live call
#   to the Claude API — everything here is computed deterministically with
#   plain Python (regex, string ops, arithmetic) from data the earlier
#   pipeline stages already produced.
#
# HOW TO READ THIS FILE (it's long — here's the map):
#   1. SKILL TAXONOMY / constants (top)      — reference data used for
#      scoring and gap-detection (skill categories, impact-language regex
#      patterns, resume-cliché/grammar regex checks).
#   2. DIMENSION SCORERS (_score_keywords, _score_format, _score_skills,
#      _score_impact, _score_length) — each independently scores one
#      aspect of the resume from 0–100. These 5 scores, weighted, become
#      the overall ATS score.
#   3. SHARED HELPERS — small utilities (_sample_skills, _first_line,
#      _extract_impact_examples, _top_job_vocab, _matched_job_terms,
#      _missing_job_terms) used by both the scorers above and the
#      text-generators below, so the written feedback always references
#      the SAME concrete terms/lines the score was actually based on
#      (not generic, disconnected boilerplate).
#   4. TEXT GENERATORS (_generate_strengths, _generate_improvements) —
#      turn the scores + shared helpers into specific, human-readable
#      bullet points quoting the user's actual resume content.
#   5. _detect_skill_gaps — cross-references the resume against both the
#      skill taxonomy and the vocabulary of the user's top-matching job
#      postings to flag which skills are present vs. missing.
#   6. _check_grammar — Formatting & Readability checks: visual flow
#      (bullet-glyph consistency, date-format consistency, wall-of-text
#      detection) plus linguistic clarity (passive voice, first-person
#      pronouns, resume clichés, filler words, overlong sentences, etc.).
#   7. enrich_resume_local() — PUBLIC ENTRY POINT. Ties everything above
#      together: runs all 5 dimension scorers, computes the weighted
#      overall ATS score, and returns one dict shaped exactly like the
#      old Claude-API JSON response so nothing downstream (e.g. main.py)
#      needs to change.
#
# WHERE THIS FITS FOR CALLERS:
#   Call `enrich_resume_local(resume, keywords, top_jobs)` with:
#     - resume:   the ParsedResume from resume_parser.parse_resume()
#     - keywords: the list from keyword_extractor.extract_keywords()
#     - top_jobs: shaped/scored job dicts (from jsearch_client + a job
#                 scorer step) — each expected to have at least
#                 "title", "description", and optionally "matched_skills".

Local NLP enrichment engine for Aura Resume Analyzer.

Replaces the Claude API call entirely — no external dependencies, no cost.
All scores are computed deterministically from the ParsedResume object
and the keyword/job data already produced by the existing pipeline.

Scoring Architecture
────────────────────
ATS Score (0–100) = weighted average of 5 dimension scores:

  Dimension        Weight   What it measures
  ─────────────    ──────   ────────────────────────────────────────────
  Keywords           25%    Keyword density vs. matched job keywords
  Format             20%    Section completeness (has summary/exp/skills/edu)
  Skills             25%    Skills block coverage & depth
  Impact             20%    Quantified achievements (numbers, %, $, metrics)
  Length             10%    Word count in the optimal 400–800 range

Each dimension score is also surfaced individually in `sections` for the
Dimension Analysis bar chart in the frontend.

Strengths / Improvements
─────────────────────────
These are generated from actual resume content — specific skill names,
real bullet lines containing metrics, and actual terms shared with (or
missing from) the user's top-matching job postings — rather than generic
template sentences, so two different resumes with the same score never
produce identical text.

#   2. LINGUISTIC CLARITY — sentence-level wording: passive voice, tense,

#
# Each issue carries a "type" so the frontend can group/label them; issues
# are deduped by type (max one of each) and capped at 6 total, ordered
# visual-flow first since structural issues are usually higher-impact and
# faster to fix than wording tweaks.
