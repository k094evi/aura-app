JSearch API client (via RapidAPI) for fetching job listings.
Endpoint: /search-v2

Freelance support
-----------------
JSearch has no native "freelance" employment type (it only reports
FULLTIME / PARTTIME / CONTRACTOR / INTERN), so freelance output is built from
four pieces:
  1. _parse_job() labels a posting "Freelance" via posting_classifier's
     classify_job_type(): "freelance" in the title, or a CONTRACTOR posting
     whose description calls it freelance. A full-time/part-time posting that
     merely mentions freelancers in passing is NOT relabelled.
  2. fetch_jobs(..., freelance_only=True) biases every query with the word
     "freelance" and drops anything not labelled "Freelance".
  3. fetch_jobs(..., include_freelance=True) keeps the normal queries and adds
     ONE extra freelance-biased query, keeping only "Freelance" postings from
     it. This is what makes the dashboard's Freelance filter have results
     without switching the whole search to freelance-only.
