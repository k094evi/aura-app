# FILE LOCATION: app/main.py
"""
PURPOSE
-------
This is the FastAPI application entry point for the "Aura" resume
analyzer backend. It's the file that gets started up to run the whole
API server — it wires together configuration, CORS, routers, and the
top-level endpoints.

Run with:
    python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

HOW IT FITS INTO THE PROGRAM
-----------------------------
This file is the hub that connects everything else together:
  - `app/config.py`                        → app-wide settings (CORS
                                              origins, upload limits,
                                              Supabase/JWT/Adzuna keys).
  - `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`         → auth-related routes
                                              (signup/login/etc.),
                                              mounted under `/api`.
  - `app/routes/parsing.py`                → resume-parsing routes,
                                              also mounted under `/api`.
  - `app/api/routes/jobs.py`               → GET /api/jobs/supported —
                                              lists the target-job roles
                                              with a skill checklist.
                                              Migrated from backend_2.
  - `app/api/routes/resumes.py`            → GET /api/resumes/{id}/analyze
                                              — re-fetches a stored
                                              resume's target-job gap.
                                              Migrated from backend_2.
  - `app/controllers/analyze_controller.py`→ the actual logic behind
                                              `POST /api/analyze`
                                              (this file just wires the
                                              HTTP layer to it).
  - `app/dependencies/auth.py`             → `get_current_user`, a
                                              FastAPI dependency that
                                              authenticates the request
                                              before `analyze_resume`
                                              runs.
  - `app/models/auth_schemas.py`           → the `AuthUser` type
                                              returned by that
                                              dependency.

REQUEST FLOW FOR /api/analyze
-------------------------------
1. Client sends a multipart POST with a resume `file`, optional
   `target_job` text, and optional `target_companies` (JSON string).
2. `get_current_user` dependency runs first — this validates the
   caller is authenticated before any resume processing happens.
3. `handle_analyze(...)` in `analyze_controller.py` does the real
   work, now also receiving `user.id` so the persisted resume row
   (see analyze_controller._persist_parsed_resume) is correctly
   attributed to the requesting user.

NOTES / THINGS WORTH DOUBLE-CHECKING
--------------------------------------
- `load_dotenv()` runs before the `app.config` import, which is
  correct — env vars need to be loaded into the process before
  `Settings()` (in config.py) reads them at import time.
- CORS is intentionally scoped down to only "GET"/"POST" and the two
  headers this API actually needs, rather than wildcarding methods
  and headers — see the inline note above the middleware for the
  reasoning.
- `logging.basicConfig(...)` here sets up a *second*, separate logging
  configuration from the shared `logger` object in
  `app/utils/logger.py`. This module's `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
  is NOT the same "aura" logger used elsewhere in the codebase — worth
  being aware of if you're trying to control log format/level in one
  place, since right now there are two independent logging setups.

    Main entry point for the resume-analysis feature.

    - `file`: the uploaded resume (PDF/DOCX — validated later by
      file_handler.validate_file inside the controller/parsing flow).
    - `target_job`: optional free-text job title/description the user
      is targeting, used to focus the analysis. Also now used to look
      up a role-specific skill checklist — see
      app/services/target_job_matcher.py.
    - `target_companies`: optional JSON-encoded list of company names
      the user is interested in (comes in as a raw string since this
      is a multipart form field, not JSON body — gets parsed inside
      handle_analyze).
    - `user`: injected by the `get_current_user` dependency, which
      runs BEFORE this function body — so unauthenticated requests
      never reach handle_analyze at all. `user.id` is now passed
      through so the persisted resume row is attributed to them.

    analyze_controller.py; this function is just the HTTP-layer glue.
